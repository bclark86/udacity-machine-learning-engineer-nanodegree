# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 

This project utilizes SageMaker and AWS to deploy a model via an API that accepts new reviews and provides a prediction of whether the review is positive or negative.
